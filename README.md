lichess-copilot is a Google Chrome extension that improves the default lichess.org sounds with the soothing voice of Dmitri Komarov and Maurice Ashley, GM Yasser Seirawan and NM John Chernoff.

The original extension is published on the Google Chrome store at: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dmitlichess/haigaafonckooggfpmjplfpbkafelcfe

I am yet to publish this extension.
